# Excel Data Cleaning Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing raw data using Microsoft Excel.  
The goal was to transform a messy dataset into a structured and analysis-ready format by applying standard and essential data cleaning techniques.

The dataset originally contained inconsistencies such as duplicates, extra spaces, blank cells, inconsistent formatting, and spelling issues.  
Using Excel tools and functions, the data was cleaned and standardized to ensure accuracy and usability for further analysis.
